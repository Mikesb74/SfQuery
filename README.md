# SfQuery

.Net-based command-line utility to query Salesforce data.

## Introduction

SFQuery uses the Salesforce REST API to perform SOQL queries based the data in your organisation.

## Setup

You will need to create a Connected App endpoint in your org for SFQuery to be able to log onto it.

You will then need to configure your credentials (username/password/connected app ID and secret) in the App.config file.
